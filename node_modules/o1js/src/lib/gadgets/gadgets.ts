   * For a left rotation, this means that bits shifted off the left end reappear at the right end.

   * Bitwise XOR gadget on {@link Field} elements. Equivalent to the [bitwise XOR `^` operator in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_XOR).
   * A XOR gate works by comparing two bits and returning `1` if two bits differ, and `0` if two bits are equal.
   *
   * This gadget builds a chain of XOR gates recursively. Each XOR gate can verify 16 bit at most. If your input elements exceed 16 bit, another XOR gate will be added to the chain.
   *
   * The `length` parameter lets you define how many bits should be compared. `length` is rounded to the nearest multiple of 16, `paddedLength = ceil(length / 16) * 16`, and both input values are constrained to fit into `paddedLength` bits. The output is guaranteed to have at most `paddedLength` bits as well.
   *
   * **Note:** Specifying a larger `length` parameter adds additional constraints.
   *
   * It is also important to mention that specifying a smaller `length` allows the verifier to infer the length of the original input data (e.g. smaller than 16 bit if only one XOR gate has been used).
   * A zkApp developer should consider these implications when choosing the `length` parameter and carefully weigh the trade-off between increased amount of constraints and security.
   *
   * **Important:** Both {@link Field} elements need to fit into `2^paddedLength - 1`. Otherwise, an error is thrown and no proof can be generated.
   *
   * For example, with `length = 2` (`paddedLength = 16`), `xor()` will fail for any input that is larger than `2**16`.
   *

   * Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_NOT).
   *
   * **Note:** The NOT gate only operates over the amount
   * of bits specified by the `length` parameter.
   *
   * A NOT gate works by returning `1` in each bit position if the
   * corresponding bit of the operand is `0`, and returning `0` if the
   * corresponding bit of the operand is `1`.
   *
   * The `length` parameter lets you define how many bits to NOT.
   *
   * **Note:** Specifying a larger `length` parameter adds additional constraints. The operation will fail if the length or the input value is larger than 254.
   *
   * NOT is implemented in two different ways. If the `checked` parameter is set to `true`
   * the {@link Gadgets.xor} gadget is reused with a second argument to be an
   * all one bitmask the same length. This approach needs as many rows as an XOR would need
   * for a single negation. If the `checked` parameter is set to `false`, NOT is
   * implemented as a subtraction of the input from the all one bitmask. This
   * implementation is returned by default if no `checked` parameter is provided.
   *
   * You can find more details about the implementation in the [Mina book](https://o1-labs.github.io/proof-systems/specs/kimchi.html?highlight=gates#not)
